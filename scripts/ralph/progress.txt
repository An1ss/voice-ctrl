## Codebase Patterns
(Patterns discovered during this feature build)

---

## US-001 - Set up project structure
**Implemented:**
- Initialized git repository
- Created Python virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`
- Set up directory structure: src/, config/, tests/, scripts/ralph/
- Created requirements.txt with 6 core dependencies
- Configured comprehensive .gitignore for Python projects
- Wrote detailed README.md with setup instructions

**Files changed:**
- .gitignore (created)
- requirements.txt (created)
- README.md (created)
- src/, config/, tests/, scripts/ralph/ directories (created)

**Learnings:**
- System uses python3 command (not python) on Ubuntu
- Python 3.12.3 is installed, well above 3.8+ requirement
- Virtual environment activation works via: source venv/bin/activate
- Git repository was not initialized yet - had to do git init first
- Used comprehensive .gitignore including IDE files and build artifacts
- README should include overview, features, requirements, setup, usage, and project structure

## US-002 - Record audio on keyboard shortcut
**Implemented:**
- Created src/recorder.py with AudioRecorder class for audio recording
- Created src/main.py as application entry point with global hotkey listener
- Created src/__init__.py to make src a proper Python package
- Implemented toggle recording behavior (press to start, press again to stop)
- Audio saved as WAV files in /tmp/ directory with timestamp filenames
- Used threading to avoid blocking keyboard listener during recording
- Configured 16kHz sample rate, mono channel for Whisper API compatibility
- Implemented 240-second maximum duration with automatic stop
- Added numpy dependency to requirements.txt

**Files changed:**
- src/recorder.py (created)
- src/main.py (created)
- src/__init__.py (created)
- requirements.txt (updated - added numpy)
- README.md (updated - added portaudio19-dev system dependency)

**Learnings:**
- sounddevice library requires system dependency: portaudio19-dev (must be installed via apt-get)
- pynput.keyboard.GlobalHotKeys is the correct class for cross-platform global hotkeys
- Audio data from sounddevice comes as float32 numpy arrays, must convert to int16 for WAV
- Threading is essential: recording runs in separate thread while keyboard listener remains responsive
- WAV files require specific format: setnchannels, setsampwidth(2 for 16-bit), setframerate
- /tmp/ directory is appropriate for temporary audio files (will be cleaned up by transcriber later)
- System dependency installation requires sudo, must be documented in README
- Audio conversion: multiply float32 by 32767 and cast to int16 for proper WAV encoding

---

## US-003 - Transcribe audio using OpenAI Whisper API
**Implemented:**
- Created src/transcriber.py with WhisperTranscriber class
- Integrated OpenAI Whisper API using the openai Python SDK (v2.15.0)
- Implemented config file reading from ~/.config/voice-ctrl/config.json with JSON parsing
- Configured API timeout to 30 seconds using OpenAI client timeout parameter
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with specific exception types
- Added automatic cleanup of temporary audio files using try/finally blocks
- Set up error logging to ~/.config/voice-ctrl/voice-ctrl.log with formatted timestamps
- Auto-create config directory (~/.config/voice-ctrl) if it doesn't exist using Path.mkdir()

**Files changed:**
- src/transcriber.py (created)

**Learnings:**
- OpenAI SDK v2.x uses client.audio.transcriptions.create() method (not Audio.transcribe())
- Must import specific exception classes: APIError, APIConnectionError, APITimeoutError, AuthenticationError, RateLimitError
- OpenAI client initialization: OpenAI(api_key=key, timeout=30.0) - timeout is a float in seconds
- Config file structure: Simple JSON with "openai_api_key" field
- File cleanup must be in finally block to ensure execution even when errors occur
- Python logging module needs basicConfig with filename, level, format, and datefmt parameters
- Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) creates all parent directories without errors if already exists
- API returns transcript object with .text attribute containing the transcribed string
- Whisper API accepts language parameter ("en" for English) though it can auto-detect
- Error logging format: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] LEVEL: message using %(asctime)s in format string
- Must open audio file in binary mode ('rb') when sending to API
- Path.unlink() deletes files, Path.exists() checks existence before deletion
- All errors should be caught, logged, and return None for graceful degradation

---

## US-004 - Insert transcribed text automatically
**Implemented:**
- Created src/paster.py with TextPaster class for clipboard-based text insertion
- Integrated TextPaster into main.py workflow (record → transcribe → paste)
- Implemented clipboard save and restore functionality with restore_clipboard parameter
- Added 100ms delay between clipboard copy and Ctrl+V to ensure clipboard readiness
- Comprehensive error handling for clipboard operations (empty text, None values, clipboard errors)
- Text pasting works via pyperclip + pynput keyboard simulation (Ctrl+V)

**Files changed:**
- src/paster.py (created)
- src/main.py (updated - added transcriber and paster integration)
- README.md (updated - added xclip system dependency)

**Learnings:**
- pyperclip requires system clipboard tool on Linux: xclip (X11), xsel, or wl-clipboard (Wayland)
- Must install xclip via apt-get: sudo apt-get install xclip
- pynput.keyboard.Controller simulates keystrokes at OS level, works across all applications
- Ctrl+V simulation: use with keyboard.pressed(Key.ctrl) context manager, then press/release 'v'
- Clipboard restore pattern: save with pyperclip.paste(), restore with pyperclip.copy() after delay
- 100ms delay (time.sleep(0.1)) between clipboard operations ensures reliability
- Edge cases handled: empty string, None, very long text all return appropriate success/failure status
- Paste returns boolean: True for success, False for failures (empty text, exceptions)
- Additional 100ms delay before restoring clipboard ensures paste operation completes
- Text truncation in logs ([:100]...) keeps console output readable for long transcriptions

## US-005 - Show system tray icon
**Implemented:**
- Created src/tray_icon.py with TrayIcon class for system tray management
- Implemented two icon states: idle (gray microphone) and recording (red microphone)
- Generated icons programmatically using PIL ImageDraw with simple microphone shapes
- Integrated tray icon into main.py with automatic state updates
- Icon runs in separate daemon thread to avoid blocking the main application
- Proper cleanup on application exit (stop icon when Ctrl+C pressed)
- Tooltip shows "Voice Control" on hover

**Files changed:**
- src/tray_icon.py (created)
- src/main.py (updated - added tray icon integration, fixed imports to use relative imports)

**Learnings:**
- pystray requires PIL (Pillow) for icon image creation
- Icon images created with Image.new('RGBA', (64, 64), (0, 0, 0, 0)) for transparent background
- PIL ImageDraw provides shapes: ellipse, rectangle, line, arc for drawing microphone icon
- pystray.Icon runs in blocking mode, must use threading.Thread(target=icon.run, daemon=True)
- Daemon thread ensures icon thread exits when main program exits
- Icon state changes via icon.icon = new_image_object (updates in real-time)
- main.py imports must be relative (.recorder, .transcriber, etc.) for proper module execution
- tray_icon.set_recording_state() called after recorder.toggle_recording() to sync icon state
- GNOME Shell on Ubuntu supports system tray icons (may need TopIcons extension on some systems)
- Test script confirmed: icon creation, start, state changes (idle↔recording), and stop all work correctly

## US-006 - Handle errors with notifications
**Implemented:**
- Created src/notifier.py with Notifier class for desktop notifications
- Integrated plyer library for cross-platform notifications (notify() function)
- Added specific notification methods for each error type:
  - notify_no_audio() - when no audio data recorded
  - notify_api_failure() - general API failures with optional details
  - notify_network_timeout() - 30-second timeout errors
  - notify_invalid_api_key() - authentication errors
  - notify_transcription_error() - general transcription errors
- Integrated notifier into transcriber.py to replace console error messages
- Integrated notifier into recorder.py to notify when no audio detected
- All errors logged to ~/.config/voice-ctrl/voice-ctrl.log with timestamp
- Notification timeout: 5 seconds for all error notifications
- Application continues running after non-fatal errors (returns None, doesn't crash)

**Files changed:**
- src/notifier.py (created)
- src/transcriber.py (updated - added notifier integration)
- src/recorder.py (updated - added notifier for no audio detection)
- test_notifier.py (created - test script)

**Learnings:**
- plyer.notification.notify() takes title, message, and timeout parameters
- plyer requires python3-dbus for best desktop integration on Linux, but has fallback
- Notifications work without sudo/special permissions on Ubuntu GNOME
- logging.basicConfig with force=True needed to override any existing logging config
- Notifier creates ~/.config/voice-ctrl/ directory automatically via Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
- Each error type should have user-friendly messages (not technical details)
- Desktop notifications appear in system notification area for 5 seconds
- Log format: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] ERROR: Type: message
- notifier.notify_error() combines both desktop notification and file logging in one call
- Application continues running after errors since we return None instead of raising exceptions
- Test script confirms: all 5 error types show notifications and log correctly
- plyer fallback works even without dbus (uses notify-send command on Linux)
